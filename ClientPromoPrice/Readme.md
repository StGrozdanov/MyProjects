Lait Capital is a client of mine that expanded their business with new offices in different cities around the country. They demanded new prices for their consumatables,
in connection with their growth. I made a program that will calculate the price of their most ordered products, depending on the previous month income, with the product prices
varying between 3 categories (or targets) to make my life easier.

The program is made with my skills from the SoftUni Basics course.
