Working on my own stuff, related to my job/training/programming

My full time job is as Sales Representative at company, distributing printer consumatables like toner cartridges, drum units, printer maintance and stationary. Depending on the orders i might add special prices and conditions, so i make programs to make my job easier.

I am training boxing for 12 years now, it's a complex sport. I workout 6 days/week, consisting of strenght training, running and boxing. I track my calories and they vary, depending on the type of training, resting days etc. I also have goals, concerning my physique and i like to make programs, tracking my progress, diaries etc.
